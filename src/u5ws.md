#### Discussion Post #1

Review the page: <https://attack.mitre.org/>

1. What terms and concepts are new to you?

2. Why, as a system administrator and not directly in security, do you think it’s so important to understand how your systems can be attacked? Isn’t it someone else’s problem to think about that?

3. What impact to the organization is data exfiltration? Even if you’re not a data owner or data custodian, why is it so important to understand the data on your systems?

#### Discussion Post #2

Find a blog or article on the web that discusses the user environment in Linux. You may want to search for .bashrc or (dot) environment files in Linux.

1. What types of customizations might you setup for your environment? Why?

2. What problems can you anticipate around helping users with their dot files?
