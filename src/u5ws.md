        <h1>Unit 5 Worksheet - Security and Systems Administration</h1>
    </p>
</div>

Unit 5 covers basic Linux and systems security concepts.

As a system administrator, it's important to know about systems security and best
practices so we can make sure everything is meeting certain standards.
Our role is an integral part of the security pipeline.

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the
discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also
expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid
foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

#### Discussion Post #1

Review the page: <https://attack.mitre.org/>

1. What terms and concepts are new to you?

2. Why, as a system administrator and not directly in security, do you think itâ€™s so important to understand how your systems can be attacked? Isnâ€™t it someone elseâ€™s problem to think about that?

3. What impact to the organization is data exfiltration? Even if youâ€™re not a data owner or data custodian, why is it so important to understand the data on your systems?

#### Discussion Post #2

Find a blog or article on the web that discusses the user environment in Linux. You may want to search for .bashrc or (dot) environment files in Linux.

1. What types of customizations might you setup for your environment? Why?

2. What problems can you anticipate around helping users with their dot files?
