### Introduction

---

Telemetry is one of the most critical parts of monitoring your system. Metrics, logs, and traces 
are often called the three pillars or the golden triangle of observability. Observability deals 
with trying to understand specific system and it can be a way to stay ahead of incoming problems. 
In dynamic environments it can give us insight to assess and manage our systems more effectively 
because without hard data (Key Performance Indicators) it is all just guessing and cannot be tracked
through time.

In this Unit 11 Lab we shall use an excellent resources on killercoda.com, online free labs and learn 
how to install tools and use them to collect and observe main types of Linux telemetry, 
each having its own value and purpose. 

### Setup monitoring with Grafana

---

1. Run through each of the three labs below in Killercoda

- https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/102-monitoring-linux-logs

-  https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/103-monitoring-linux-telemetry

- https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/104-monitoring-linux-Influx-Grafana

2. While completing each lab think about the following:
    
    - a. How does it tie into the diagram below?

    - b. What could you improve, or what would you change based on your previous administration experience.

### Required Materials

---

- Access to internet (Killercoda labs)
- Rocky 9+ Machine, Container, or Lab
- root or sudo command access

### Conclusion

---

In the end monitoring is more an art than engineering. Sure, we can design all the systems to track all
the things, but thereâ€™s no equation on what is the one right answer for any of this. You have to spend
time with the systems, know what is important and what is an indicator of problems. Then, you have to 
consider your audience and how to best show them what they need to see.
