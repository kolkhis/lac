## Unit 3 Worksheet

---

## Introduction

Understanding system reliability and high availability is crucial for modern enterprise Linux environments. This unit explores the fundamental concepts of system uptime, failure modes, and incident response, with a practical focus on implementing HA solutions using industry-standard tools and practices.

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

#### Discussion Post #1

Scan the chapter [here](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html) for keywords and pull out what you think will help you to better understand how to triage an incident.

Read the section called "Operation Security" in this same chapter: [Building Secure and Reliable Systems](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html)

1. What important concepts do you learn about how we behave during an 
operational response to an incident?

#### Discussion Post #2

Ask Google, find a blog, or ask an AI about high availability. (Here's one if you need it: [AWS Real-Time Communication Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/real-time-communication-on-aws.pdf#high-availability-and-scalability-on-aws)

1. What are some important terms you read about? Why do you think understanding 
HA will help you better in the context of triaging incidents?

## Digging Deeper

---

1. If uptime is so important to us, why is it so important to us to also understand how our systems can fail? Why would we focus on the thing that does not drive uptime?

2. Start reading about SLOs: [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/)
How does this help you operationally?
Does it make sense that keeping systems within defined parameters will help keep 
them operating longer?
