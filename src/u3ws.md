        <h1>Unit 3 Worksheet - Systems Reliability and High Availability in Enterprise Linux </h1>
    </p>
</div>

Understanding system reliability and high availability is crucial for modern
enterprise Linux environments. This unit explores the fundamental concepts of system
uptime, failure modes, and incident response, with a practical focus on implementing
HA solutions using industry-standard tools and practices.

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion
thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is
to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

#### Discussion Post #1

Scan the chapter [here](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html) for keywords and pull out what you think will help you to better understand how to triage an incident.

Read the section called "Operation Security" in this same chapter: [Building Secure and Reliable Systems](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html)

1. What important concepts do you learn about how we behave during an
   operational response to an incident?

#### Discussion Post #2

Ask Google, find a blog, or ask an AI about high availability. (Here's one if you need it: [AWS Real-Time Communication Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/real-time-communication-on-aws.pdf#high-availability-and-scalability-on-aws)

1. What are some important terms you read about? Why do you think understanding
   HA will help you better in the context of triaging incidents?

## Digging Deeper

---

1. If uptime is so important to us, why is it so important to us to also understand how our systems can fail? Why would we focus on the thing that does not drive uptime?

2. Start reading about SLOs: [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/)
   How does this help you operationally?
   Does it make sense that keeping systems within defined parameters will help keep
   them operating longer?

## Reflection Questions

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How are you going to use what you've learned in your current role?
