        <h1>Unit 12 - Baselines & Benchmarks</h1>
    </p>
</div>

## Overview

---

In this unit, we focus on **baselining, benchmarking, testing methodology, and data analytics** — all essential skills for Linux system administrators. These topics allow us to understand the current state of our systems, measure performance under varying loads, and validate improvements with real data.

We’ll explore how to gather accurate system information using tools like **iostat, sar, stress, and iperf3**, and learn how to develop test plans that can support decision-making and capacity planning. Whether you're justifying budget increases or validating a new storage solution, knowing how to gather and present performance data makes you a more effective administrator.

## Learning Objectives

---

**By the end of this unit, you will be able to**:

- Define and use key concepts: **baseline, benchmark, high watermark, scope, and methodology**
- Use tools like **sar, iostat, stress**, and **iperf3** to collect performance data
- Create and execute test plans to evaluate system behavior under different loads
- Apply data analytics concepts: **descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive**
- Communicate system performance clearly with stakeholders through objective evidence

## Relevance & Context

---

Understanding how your systems behave under normal and stressful conditions is a cornerstone of professional Linux administration. In today’s environments, decisions about agents, updates, or infrastructure changes require proof — not guesswork.

This unit prepares you to be the voice of data in meetings with architects and management. From proving system utilization for budget requests to testing performance claims from vendors, these skills help you become a confident, evidence-driven engineer.

## Prerequisites

---

- Familiarity with resource categories: **CPU, memory, disk, and networking**
- Access to a Rocky 9 (or similar) Linux system with **sudo or root access**
- Ability to install and use CLI tools (`dnf install`, `rpm`, etc.)
