#### Discussion Post #1

Scenario:

<blockquote>

A ticket has come in from an application team. Some of the servers your team built for them last week
have not been reporting up to enterprise monitoring and they need it to be able to troubleshoot a current
issue, but they have no data. You jump on the new servers and find that your engineer built everything
correctly and the agents for node_exporter, ceph_exporter and logstash exporter that your teams use. But,
they also have adhered to the new company standard of firewalld must be running. No one has documented the
ports that need to be open, so you’re stuck between the new standards and fixing this problem on live systems.

</blockquote>

Next, answer these questions here:

1. As you’re looking this up, what terms and concepts are new to you?

2. What are the ports that you need to expose? How did you find the answer?

3. What are you going to do to fix this on your firewall?

#### Discussion Post #2

Scenario:

<blockquote>

A manager heard you were the one that saved the new application by fixing the firewall. They get your manager
to approach you with a request to review some documentation from a vendor that is pushing them hard to run a
WAF in front of their web application. You are “the firewall” guy now, and they’re asking you to give them a
review of the differences between the firewalls you set up (which they think should be enough to protect them)
and what a WAF is doing.

</blockquote>

1. What do you know about the differences now?

2. What are you going to do to figure out more?

3. Prepare a report for them comparing it to the firewall you did in the first discussion.
