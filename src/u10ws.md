## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion
thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is
to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

## Discussion Questions

#### Discussion Post #1

Read: [Kubernetes Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/)

1. What are the two most compelling reasons to implement Kubernetes in your organization?

2. The article states that Kubernetes is not a PaaS. What does that mean? How does Kubernetes compare to a traditional PaaS?

#### Discussion Post #2

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your team is troubleshooting a Kubernetes cluster where applications are failing to deploy. They send you the following output:

```sh
[root@Test_Cluster1 ~]# kubectl version
Client Version: v1.31.6+k3s3
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
Server Version: v1.30.6+k3s1

[root@rocky15 ~]# kubectl get nodes
NAME            STATUS      ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
Test_Cluster1   Ready       control-plane,master   17h   v1.30.6+k3s1
Test_Cluster2   NotReady    worker                 33m   v1.29.6+k3s1
Test_Cluster3   Ready       worker                 17h   v1.28.6+k3s1
```

</blockquote>

1. How would you validate the error?

2. What do you suspect is causing the problem?

3. Has someone already attempted to fix this problem? Why or why not?

### Discussion Post #3

Scenario:

<blockquote>

You are the Network Operations Center (NOC) lead, and your team is responsible
for monitoring development, test, and QA Kubernetes clusters.

</blockquote>

Write a basic cluster health check procedure for new NOC personnel.

1. What online resources did you use to figure this out?

2. What did you learn during this process?
