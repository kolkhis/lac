#### Discussion Post #1

Read: [Kubernetes Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/)

1. What are the two most compelling reasons to implement Kubernetes in your organization?

2. The article states that Kubernetes is not a PaaS. What does that mean? How does Kubernetes compare to a traditional PaaS?

#### Discussion Post #2

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your team is troubleshooting a Kubernetes cluster where applications are failing to deploy. They send you the following output:

```sh
[root@Test_Cluster1 ~]# kubectl version
Client Version: v1.31.6+k3s3
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
Server Version: v1.30.6+k3s1

[root@rocky15 ~]# kubectl get nodes
NAME            STATUS      ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
Test_Cluster1   Ready       control-plane,master   17h   v1.30.6+k3s1
Test_Cluster2   NotReady    worker                 33m   v1.29.6+k3s1
Test_Cluster3   Ready       worker                 17h   v1.28.6+k3s1
```

</blockquote>

1. How would you validate the error?

2. What do you suspect is causing the problem?

3. Has someone already attempted to fix this problem? Why or why not?

### Discussion Post #3

Scenario:

<blockquote>

You are the Network Operations Center (NOC) lead, and your team is responsible
for monitoring development, test, and QA Kubernetes clusters.

</blockquote>

Write a basic cluster health check procedure for new NOC personnel.

1. What online resources did you use to figure this out?

2. What did you learn during this process?

## Digging Deeper

---

1. Build a custom container and deploy it in Kubernetes securely.
2. Read about container security:
   - [Docker Security Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/)
   - [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
3. Complete this Kubernetes security lab:
   - [KillerShell Kubernetes Security](https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-cks/scenario/static-manual-analysis-k8s)

## Reflection Questions

---

1. What questions do you still have about Kubernetes?

2. How can you apply this knowledge in your current IT role?

3. If you’re not in IT, how could this experience contribute to your resume or portfolio?
