        <h1>Unit 7 Worksheet - Security and Package Management</h1>
    </p>
</div>

This unit is all about understanding security and package management on Linux systems.

Securing systems is not just the job of security engineers. It falls on system
administrators and system engineers to ensure all security best practices are
enforced on their systems to meet certain standards.

Whether it is software compatibility or security, ensuring all the correct packages are on the
system _and_ ensuring the package versions match the needs of the users is a crucial
skill for any sysadmin.

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the
discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also
expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid
foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

#### Discussion Post #1

1. Why is software versioning so important to software security?

2. Can you find 3 reasons, from the internet, AI, or your peers?

#### Discussion Post #2

Scenario:

<blockquote>

You are new to a Linux team. A ticket has come in from an application team and has
already been escalated to your manager.

They want software installed on one of their servers but you cannot find any
documentation. Your security team is out to lunch and not responding.

You remember from some early documentation that you read that all the software in the
internal repos you currently have are approved for deployment on servers.
You want to also verify by checking other servers that this software exists.

This is an urgent task and your manager is hovering.

</blockquote>

1. How can you check all the repos on your system to see which are active?

2. How would you check another server to see if the software was installed there?

3. If you find the software, how might you figure out when it was installed? (Time/Date)

#### Discussion Post #3

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Looking at the concept of group install from DNF or Yum.
Why do you think an administrator may never want to use that in a running system?
Why might an engineer want to or not want to use that?
This is a thought exercise, so it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúright or wrong‚Äù answer it‚Äôs for you to think about.

</blockquote>

1. What is the concept of software bloat, and how do you think it relates?

2. What is the concept of a security baseline, and how do you think it relates?

3. How do you think something like this affects performance baselines?
