## Overview

---

This unit introduces **Kubernetes (K8s)**, an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The unit covers:

- **Understanding Kubernetes Architecture** – Nodes, Control Plane, and Cluster Components.
- **Installing K3s** – A lightweight Kubernetes distribution optimized for resource efficiency.
- **Interacting with Kubernetes** – Using `kubectl` to manage and troubleshoot clusters.
- **Deploying Applications** – Creating and managing **Pods, Deployments, and Services**.
- **Security and Best Practices** – Implementing security measures and troubleshooting issues.

Kubernetes plays a critical role in **modern enterprise infrastructure**, enabling **scalability, high availability, and automation** in cloud-native applications.

## Learning Objectives

---

By the end of this unit, learners will:

1. **Understand the Core Concepts of Kubernetes:**

   - Define Kubernetes and explain its role in container orchestration.
   - Differentiate between **Kubernetes vs. PaaS (Platform as a Service)**.

2. **Deploy and Manage Kubernetes Clusters:**

   - Install **K3s** and verify its functionality.
   - Manage cluster resources using `kubectl`.

3. **Perform Basic Kubernetes Operations:**

   - Create and manage **Pods, Deployments, and Services**.
   - Understand the role of **Namespaces, ConfigMaps, and Secrets**.

4. **Troubleshoot Kubernetes Clusters:**

   - Identify common cluster issues and validate node status.
   - Diagnose networking and pod scheduling problems.

5. **Apply Security Best Practices in Kubernetes:**

   - Secure containerized applications using best practices.
   - Implement **Kubernetes Pod Security Standards**.

## Relevance & Context

---

Kubernetes is a **foundational technology in modern DevOps and cloud computing**. Understanding it is critical for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and site reliability engineers (SREs) for several reasons:

- **Scalability & Automation** – Automates containerized application deployments, scaling, and management.
- **Resource Efficiency** – Optimizes workload distribution across multiple nodes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Kubernetes configurations can be defined declaratively using YAML.
- **Cross-Cloud Compatibility** – Supports deployment across on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.
- **High Availability & Self-Healing** – Detects and replaces failed instances automatically.

## Prerequisites

---

Before beginning this unit, learners should have:

- A working knowledge of **Linux system administration**.
- Experience using the **command line (`bash`, `ssh`, `vim`)**.
- Familiarity with **containers** and tools like Docker.
- Basic **networking knowledge**, including IP addressing and port management.
