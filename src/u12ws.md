        <h1>Unit 12 Worksheet - Baselining and Benchmarking Systems</h1>
    </p>
</div>

This unit is all about data -- learning how to baseline and benchmark systems.  
Being able to establish a baseline for systems is essential as a sysadmin for knowing
when your system is acting strangely, among other things.

Benchmarking and baselining go together. Without a baseline, you'll have no point of
reference when running a benchmark.

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion
thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is
to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

#### Discussion Post #1

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your manager has come to you with another emergency.

He has a meeting next week to discuss capacity planning and usage of the system with IT upper management.
He doesnâ€™t want to lose his budget, but he has to prove that the system utilization warrants spending more.

</blockquote>

1. What information can you show your manager from your systems?

2. What type of data would prove system utilization? (Remember the big 4: compute,
   memory, disk, networking)

3. What would your report look like to your manager?

#### Discussion Post #2

Scenario:

<blockquote>

You are in a capacity planning meeting with a few of the architects.
They have decided to add 2 more agents to your Linus sytems, Bacula Agent and an Avamar Agent.
They expect these agents to run their work starting at 0400 every morning.

</blockquote>

![24 hour view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b0fbcb-6ac6-402c-8e3f-4c0a39ca858b)

1. What do these agents do? (May have to look them up)

2. Do you think there is a good reason not to use these agents at this timeframe?

3. Is there anything else you might want to point out to these architects about these agents they are installing?

#### Discussion Post #3

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your team has recently tested at proof of concept of a new
storage system. The vendor has published the blazing fast speeds that are capable of being
run through this storage system. You have a set of systems connected to both the old
storage system and the new storage system.

</blockquote>

1. Write up a test procedure of how you may test these two systems.

2. How are you assuring these test are objective?
   - What is meant by the term Ceteris Paribus, in this context?

## Digging Deeper (optional)

---

1. Analyzing data may open up a new field of interest to you. Go through some of the  
   free lessons on Kaggle, here: https://www.kaggle.com/learn

   - What did you learn?
   - How will you apply these lessons to data and monitoring you have already  
     collected as a system administrator?

2. Find a blog or article that discusses the 4 types of data analytics.

   - What did you learn about past operations?
   - What did you learn about predictive operations?

3. Download Spyder IDE (Open source).
   - Find a blog post or otherwise try to evaluate some data.
   - Perform some Linear regression. My block of code (but this requires some  
     additional libraries to be added. I can help with that if you need it.)
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
     size = [[5.0], [5.5], [5.9], [6.3], [6.9], [7.5]]
     price =[[165], [200], [223], [250], [278], [315]]
     plt.title('Pizza Price plotted against the size')
     plt.xlabel('Pizza Size in inches')
     plt.ylabel('Pizza Price in cents')
     plt.plot(size, price, 'k.')
     plt.axis([5.0, 9.0, 99, 355])
     plt.grid(True)
     model = LinearRegression()
     model.fit(X = size, y = price)
     #plot the regression line
     plt.plot(size, model.predict(size), color='r')
     ```

## Reflection Questions

---

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How can you apply this now in your current role in IT?  
   If youâ€™re not in IT, how can you look to put something like this into your resume or
   portfolio?
