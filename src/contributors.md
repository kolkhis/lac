This book was made possible by a small group of dedicated contributors who worked diligently to create an accessible resource for future students enrolled in courses offered by the Professional Linux User Group.

The group met weekly to organize efforts, manage contributions, and onboard new volunteers. Using Git for version control and GitHub for project management, they converted existing courseware into Markdown and HTML. The content was then compiled with mdBook into a fast, searchable, multimedia learning resource.
