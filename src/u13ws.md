        <h1>Unit 13 - Linux System Security</h1>
    </p>
</div>

This unit covers basic security concepts on Linux systems.

We'll go over what security standards are, tools used to implement security
standards, and other systems employed to secure Linux systems.

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion
thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is
to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

#### Discussion Post #1

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your security team comes to you with a discrepancy between
the production security baseline and something that is running on one of your servers in
production. There are 5 servers in a web cluster and only one of them is showing this
behavior. They want you to account for why something is different.

</blockquote>

1. How are you going to validate that the difference between the systems?

2. What are you going to look at to explain this?

3. What could be done to prevent this problem in the future?

#### Discussion Post #2

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your team has been giving you more and more engineering responsibilities.  
You are being asked to build out the next set of servers to integrate into the
development environment. Your team is going from RHEL 8 to Rocky 9.4.

</blockquote>

1. How might you start to plan out your migration?

2. What are you going to check on the existing systems to baseline your build?

3. What kind of validation plan might you use for your new Rocky 9.4 systems?
