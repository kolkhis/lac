Enhance productivity by enabling the management of multiple sessions and windows from a single remote session.

## 🔑 Key Features of Terminal Multiplexors

---

### Create Multiple Windows/Panes 🪟

Split your terminal into panes (or windows) so you can run different commands or tasks simultaneously.

### Detach and Reattach Sessions 🪝

You can detach from a session (e.g., when you log out of a remote server), and later reattach to it exactly as you left it.

### Persistence of Long-Running Tasks ⏰

If your network connection drops, the tasks keep running on the server, and you can reattach to them later.

### Collaborate 🤝

Some terminal multiplexers allow multiple users to connect to the same session, enabling collaborative work on a single system.

### 🦀 Zellij

Zellij, first released in 2020 and written in Rust, is a newcomer to the terminal multiplexer space that focuses on an intuitive UI and easy collaboration. While its modern approach and built-in layout management offer clear advantages over older tools, its relatively small community and limited ecosystem may pose challenges for widespread adoption.

- Although not yet included in the default repositories of all distributions, Zellij is rapidly gaining visibility because of its modern design and user-friendly layout management.
- Its growing ecosystem of plugins and emphasis on collaboration make it an attractive choice for developers seeking a more advanced terminal multiplexer.
