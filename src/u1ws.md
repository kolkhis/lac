### Instructions

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned topics. Take the time
to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction
with peers is also expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of
knowledge.
