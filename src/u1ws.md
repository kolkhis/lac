        <h1>Unit 1 Worksheet - Linux Fundamentals and Systems Editing Tools</h1>
    </p>
</div>

Welcome to Unit 1 of the Professional Linux Users Group (ProLUG) Systems Administration Course.
With this worksheet students will explore the foundations of Linux and its many constituent parts.

Specifically, this unit and worksheet aim to cover concepts such as the command line interface (CLI),
commands and syntax, command line tools, Vim (visual editor improved), the Linux Kernel, and much more.

Students are strongly encouraged to learn from these units and apply what they learn. Applying what you
learn offers no better teacher. Again welcome, and good luck in your studies.
