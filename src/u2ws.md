        <h1>Unit 2 Worksheet - Systems Administration Fundamentals</h1>
    </p>
</div>

Unit 2 is all about essential tools. Working with files, redirecting output,
and managing permissions are all fundamental skills that any Linux sysadmin will need.

In this unit, we cover:

- How to use ACLs to manage file permissions, and introduces SELinux as an
  additional layer of security that adds labels and contexts to files and processes.
- The importance of note-taking for systems administrators and engineers
- Difference between troubleshooting in systems administration versus systems engineering.
- Security and the importance of availability as a primary goal for systems administrators.
- Key networking concepts such as IP addresses, routing, and DNS are introduced,
  along with tools for troubleshooting network issues

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the discussion
thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also expected; the goal is
to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Fill out this worksheet as you watch the unit video.
Discussion posts can be completed afterwards, answers to be posted in Discord.
You must both answer the discussion questions and respond to another student's
answers. This is only required if you want the certification.

#### Unit 2 Discussion Post #1

Think about how week 1 went for you.

1. Did you get everything you needed to done?

2. Do you need to allocate more time to the course, and if so, how do you plan to do it?

3. How well did you take notes during the lecture? Do you need to improve this?

#### Unit 2 Discussion Post #2

Read a blog, check a search engine, or ask an AI about SELinux.  
What is the significance of contexts? What are the significance of labels?

Scenario:

<blockquote>

You follow your company instructions to add a new user to a set of 10 Linux
servers. They cannot access just one of the servers.

When you review the differences in the servers you see that the server they
cannot access is running SELINUX. On checking other users have no problem
getting into the system.

You find nothing in the documentation (typical) about this different system or
how these users are accessing it.

</blockquote>

What do you do?  
Where do you check?

You may use any online resources to help you answer this. This is not a trick
and it is not a ‚Äúone answer solution‚Äù. This is for you to think through.

## Digging Deeper

---

1. How does troubleshooting differ between system administration and system
   engineering? To clarify, how might you troubleshoot differently if you know a
   system was previously running correctly. If you‚Äôre building a new system out?

2. Investigate a troubleshooting methodology, by either Google or AI search.
   Does the methodology fit for you in an IT sense, why or why not?

## Reflection Questions

---

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How are you going to use what you‚Äôve learned in your current role?
