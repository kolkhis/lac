        <h1>Unit 8 - Bash Scripting</h1>
    </p>
</div>

 
Welcome to Unit 8.
This unit is all about Bash -- the shell that we use on Linux.  
Understanding Bash is crucial to anyone who administers Linux systems.  
Bash scripting gives us the ability to automate tasks and create a simple solution for complex tasks.  
If you've ever used the command line on a Linux system before, you've already written
Bash code! Scripting is simply the act of taking those commands and putting them into
an executable file.

## Instructions

---

A major aspect of this course is to intake, comprehend, and discuss the assigned
topics. Take the time to fully absorb each topic and contribute to the
discussion thread by sharing your thoughts. Interaction with peers is also
expected; the goal is to compare and contrast ideas to build a solid
foundation of knowledge.

#### Discussion Post #1

<blockquote>
It’s a 2 week holiday in your country and most of the engineers and architects who designed the system are out of town.  
You’ve noticed a pattern of logs filling up on a set of web servers from increased traffic.  
Your research shows, and then you verify, that the logs are being sent off real time to Splunk.  
Your team has just been deleting the logs every few days, but one of the 3rd shift engineers didn’t read the notes and your team suffered downtime.  
How might you implement a simple fix to stop gap the problem before all the engineering resources come back next week?
</blockquote>

1.  What resources helped you answer this?

2.  Why can’t you just make a design fix and add space in /var/log on all these systems?

3.  Why can’t you just make a design change and logrotate more often so this doesn’t happen?

4.  For 2,3 if you are ok with that, explain your answer. (This isn’t a trick, maybe there is a valid reason.)

#### Discussion Post #2

<blockquote>
You are the only Linux Administrator at a small healthcare company.  
The engineer/admin before you left you a lot of scripts to untangle.  
This is one of our many tasks as administrators, so you set out to accomplish it.  
You start to notice that he only ever uses nested `if` statements in bash.  
You also notice that every loop is a conditional `while true`, and then he breaks the loop after a decision test each loop.  
You know his stuff works, but you think it could be more easily written for supportability, for you and future admins.  
You decide to write up some notes by reading some google, AI, and talking to your peers.
</blockquote>

1. Compare the use of nested if versus case statement in bash.

2. Compare the use of conditional and counting loops. Under what circumstances would you use one or the other?

## Reflection Questions

---

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. Just knowing a lot about scripting doesn’t help much against actually doing it in 
   a practical sense.
   What things are you doing currently at work or in a lab that you can apply some of 
   this logic to?
